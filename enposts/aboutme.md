# About me

* At the end of 1985, I was fortunate to come into contact with IBM PC and began to learn to use BASIC and X86 assembly programming. It has been more than 35 years in a flash.
* After 36 years of career, I can finally retire. No longer 9 to 5, still a little unaccustomed.
* I have nothing to do, start a blog, make myself feel like I'm not a worthless person yet
* The computer systems with historical memory that have been contacted include
    - PDP-11
    - VAX II
    - IBM PC/XT, PC/AT
    - PC-9801
    - APPLE II
    - The rest are conventional computers that we all know well.
* The operating systems with historical vicissitudes that have been exposed to are:
    - DOS (PC-DOS, MS-DOS, FreeDOS)
    - OS/2
    - UNIX
    - VMS

    - BASIC
    - x86 assembly
